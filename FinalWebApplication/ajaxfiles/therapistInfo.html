            <p>My name is Sharlene Nelson, and I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker Associate in North Carolina. East Carolina University is where I earned my Masters in Social Work. I also graduated from East Carolina University with a bachelor's degree
                in Psychology and a minor in Child Development/Family Relations, as well as a master's degree in social work. So far, the focus of my career has been on children and families. I specialize on anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder,
                phobias, adjustment issues, and understanding early development. I've also dealt with those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol. My zeal has shaped me in the path of teaching and aiding children and families in accomplishing their goals.
                We have always emphasized the need of being involved in our community.</p>
